# Quote Application

This project is a application I built for a friend to use as a real world tool.

The intent of the application is to make it easier for the user to give customers quotes based on measurments.

The user can set the Cost per meter squared (default is $75), they can then add the dimensions then add that to the quote. 

The table then runs a calculation to give them the total required material for the job and cost. 

### Now Live http://quotetool.surge.sh/

I have implimented some features also:

- ability to set cost

- ability to add and remove single items from the quote. 

- ability to delete every item from the qoute, doing this gives the user a warning and must confirm. 

- also implimented speech recognition for entering the inputs (this does not work outside of Chrome Browser, whcih is a shame).

features I want to impliment:

~~[] storing table to localStorage until **new quote** is selected.~~

[x] restyling completely, using Skeleton CSS currently for basic styling. **Moved styling over to Materialize CSS**

Update to Materialize CSS
